                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a Senior attending Washington University in St. Louis planning on graduating in May of 2026. I am a Data Science 
                    major with a second major in Educational Studies. I have a deep interest in combining my knowledge of these two fields into
                    practical applications. I also enjoy developing and designing video games in Unity with one of my classmates Zach Susee.</p>

                <h3>Website</h3>
                    <p>After having enough projects to display, I decided to learn both HTML and CSS in order to display them in this website
                    created with my own code. I got my introduction knowledge through courses on Codecademy and then read docs to supplment. </p>

                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p>I had always wanted to design my own video game since childhood, and learning code in college gave me the tools to actually do so 
                    I took courses on Udemy and Unity to gain the basic knowledge for 2D games and decided to create a tower defense game as my first project.</p>
                <h3>Data Science NBA Scraper/Analyzer</h3>
                    <p>Along with three of my classmates, I created a scraper that read in the past 4 years of NBA player data tracking
                    key statistics such as points, rebounds, games played, and contract salary. These players were then ranked based on their 
                    salary, including an interactive app that allowed the user to weight each statistic based on their interest/need.</p>
