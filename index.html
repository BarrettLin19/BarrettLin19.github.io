                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a Senior attending Washington University in St. Louis planning on graduating in May of 2026. I am a Data Science 
                major with a second major in Educational Studies. I have a deep interest in combining my knowledge of these two fields into
                practical applications.</p>

                <h3>Website</h3>
                <p>After having enough projects to display, I decided to learn both HTML and CSS in order to display them in this website
                 created through my own code.</p>
